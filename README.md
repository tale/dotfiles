# Dotfiles
```sh
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tale/dotfiles/main/bootstrap.sh | bash -
```
All of the files with the dots in them, but with a few requirements:
- It has to be easy, because I'm lazy
- Deterministic and easily bootstrapped
- Minimal shell, snappy responsiveness

Features:
- Nix
- Bash
- Tmux
- Neovim
- Aerospace (Tiling WM on macOS)
