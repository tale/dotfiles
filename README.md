# Dotfiles
Many files with dots before them! ðŸŽ‰
These dotfiles are mostly for my personal use, but feel free to use them as inspiration for your own dotfiles.
I don't have a very complicated setup and I definitely emphasize macOS over Linux. Components are listed below.

```sh
bash <(curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tale/dotfiles/main/scripts/setup.sh)
```

### Whats Inside?
- Support for both macOS and any Enterprise Linux (RHEL, Fedora, Oracle, etc)
- Easy installation that it can be executed via a `curl` command
- Git, Zsh, Neovim, GPG/SSH configs, all the goodies
- [Ghostty](https://ghostty.org): a new terminal emulator with insane performance
- [Mise](https://mise.jdx.dev): per-directory and global devtools (like `asdf`)
- [Yabai](https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai): Tiling WM for macOS
- [Zed](https://zed.dev): VS-code but Rust and fast
